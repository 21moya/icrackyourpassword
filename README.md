This is a little tool that helps you decrypting a password sent from Alice to Bob. (This is for my IT-Security course so you can't really do anything with it, except you're part of it.)


## Instructions
This tool is easy to use and fully automatic, meaning you don't need to communicate with either Alice or Bob directly‚Äîthe program handles it for you. Before you begin, follow these steps:
### 1) Install All Dependencies
In the `root` directory of the program, open the console and install all dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
For better dependency management, you can create and activate a virtual environment:\
**Create a Virtual Environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
**Activate the Environment:**
- On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- on macOS/Linux
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
**Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**\
When you're done, deactivate the virtual environment by running:
```bash
deactivate
```

### 2) Execute the Code
Once everything is set up, run the program with:
```bash
python src/main.py
```
